// Step 5 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

// Question 1
First line of OS/161 code that is executed when a trap occurs is either `mips_utlb_handler` found on line 68 in exception-mips1.S or `mips_general_handler` found on line 86 in exception-mips1.S
Control gets transferred to `common_exception` on line 104 in exception-mips1.S


// Question 2
syscall-mips.S line 84


// Question 3
Standard C functions that are commonly used.
In common/libc because these standard library functions are used both by the kernel and user-level programs.
In userland/lib/libc because protection & restricting privileges


// Question 4
Configure configures default location of the root of the installed system and target hardware platform and machine type.
Running the configure script not from the top of the OS/161 tree might invalidate that configuration and make you need/want to rerun it or if you want to change location of source tree


// Question 5
Functions can be machine dependent if it relies on specific register structures or instruction sets that that machine implements.
We would want to maintain this separation so that functions can be ran on different machines to avoid having to rewrite spcific code


// Question 6
148 bytes (4 bytes * 37 uint32), as defined in trapframe.h in lines 40 ~ 78 why is it large?
needs to store all of userland registers


// Question 7
If you are running in a new machine or if the directory of your source tree changes or if you want to change where the system should be installed


// Question 8
bmake depend updates the header file depend information
compile the DUMBVM kernel


// Question 9
bmake compiles the DUMBVM kernel in its source directory; bmake install installs that program in the right place in ~/root/os161


// Question 10
Append a new print hello world command to cmdtable on line 530 in menu.c for example `{ "print", printHelloWorld }` and write a function definition for the funciton printHelloWorld in the same file to run `kprintf("Hello World")`


// Question 11
Relying solely on standard utilites present on the machine does not provide strong isolation if applications are distrustful and do not provide efficient time sharing


// Question 12
in crt0.S
The return value of main is saved to s0 (which is callee-save) so we still have it in case exit() returns.


// Question 13
syscall.h (src\build\install\include\kern\ or src\kern\include\kern\)


// Step 7 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

// Question 14
